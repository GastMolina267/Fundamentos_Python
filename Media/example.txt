Lyrics...ðŸŽµ

When you get I older, plainer saner
Will you remember all the danger we came from

Burning like embers, falling, tender
Long before the days of no surrender
Years ago and welll you know

So smoke 'em if you got 'em
'Cause it's going down all I ever wanted was you

I'll never get to heaven
'Cause I don't know how 
let's raise a glass or two

To all the things I lost on you (Oh, oh)
Tell me are they lost on you (Oh ,oh)
Just that you cold cut me loose (Oh, oh)

After everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Is that lost on you (Oh, oh)

Baby is that lost on you
Is that lost on you

Wish I could see them 
Back in nations understand the tiol
Of expectations in your mind

Hold me like you never lost to patience
Tell me that you love me more than hate
Me all the time and you're still mine

So smoke 'em if you got 'em
'Cause it's going down all I ever wanted was you

Let's take a drink of ever lisk
And turn around let's raise a glass or two

To all the things I've lost on you (Oh, oh)
Tell me are they lost on you (Oh ,oh)
Just that you could cut me loose (Oh, oh)

After everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Is that lost on you (Oh, oh)

Baby is that lost on you
Is that lost on you

Let's raise a glass or two
To all the things I've lost you (Oh, oh)

Tell me are they lost on you (Oh, oh)
Just that you cold cut me loose (Oh, oh)
After everything I've lost on you

Is that lost on you
Is that lost on you
